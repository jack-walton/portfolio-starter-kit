I have wanted to develop a personal website for sometime now.



I used generative AI to alter the posts component to truncate the date when it gets too long. I had to go through a few iterations, but I ended up with results that I liked.

![The date doesn't look good.](/images/bad-date.png "Optional title")

![The date looks good.](/images/good-date.png "Optional title")

As you can see, the original code for the BlogPosts component displayed the date based data imported from a utility that processes the post's metadata:

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import { formatDate, getBlogPosts } from 'app/blog/utils'

export function BlogPosts() {
  let allBlogs = getBlogPosts()

  return (
    <div>
      {allBlogs
        .sort((a, b) => {
          if (
            new Date(a.metadata.publishedAt) > new Date(b.metadata.publishedAt)
          ) {
            return -1
          }
          return 1
        })
        .map((post) => (
          <Link
            key={post.slug}
            className="flex flex-col space-y-1 mb-4"
            href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}
          >
            <div className="w-full flex flex-col md:flex-row space-x-0 md:space-x-2">
              <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 w-[100px] tabular-nums">
                {formatDate(post.metadata.publishedAt, false)}
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 tracking-tight">
                {post.metadata.title}
              </p>
            </div>
          </Link>
        ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

I changed it to this:
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import { getBlogPosts } from 'app/blog/utils'

export function BlogPosts() {
  let allBlogs = getBlogPosts()

  // Custom date formatting function to handle truncation and correct date parsing
  const formatCustomDate = (dateString) => {
    // Parse ISO date string (e.g., "2025-08-01")
    const [year, month, day] = dateString.split('-').map(Number);
    const monthNames = [
      'January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June',
      'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'
    ];
    const shortMonthNames = [
      'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',
      'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'
    ];
    // Use zero-based month index correctly (month - 1 for array access)
    const fullDate = `${monthNames[month - 1]} ${day}, ${year}`;
    
    // Truncate to short month if date string is longer than 10 characters
    if (fullDate.length > 10) {
      return `${shortMonthNames[month - 1]} ${day}, ${year}`;
    }
    return fullDate;
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {allBlogs
        .sort((a, b) => {
          if (
            new Date(a.metadata.publishedAt) > new Date(b.metadata.publishedAt)
          ) {
            return -1
          }
          return 1
        })
        .map((post) => (
          <Link
            key={post.slug}
            className="flex flex-col space-y-1 mb-4"
            href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}
          >
            <div className="w-full flex flex-col md:flex-row space-x-0 md:space-x-2">
              <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 w-[100px] tabular-nums">
                {formatCustomDate(post.metadata.publishedAt)}
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 tracking-tight">
                {post.metadata.title}
              </p>
            </div>
          </Link>
        ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Another issue that I faced that the template for this blog couldn't handle out-of-the-box was images in the blog posts. After some quick desk research, I learned that next.js apps need a `public` folder to store these assets. I created one and added the images that you see on this page to it. But I didn't like the way they were styled. The background from the images blended in with the app's UI, so I needed to implement a border. I decided the most consistent way to achieve this would be to create a CSS rule in the global stylesheet for the `img` element that reflected the style of the code blocks. Thus, I implemented the following CSS rule:

```css
img {
  @apply px-1 py-0.5 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-900 overflow-hidden;
}
```

As you can see, this enhancement worked as expected. The `img` elements now have a border that matches the border from the `pre` elements.

Finally, I wasn't sure whether the width of the blog content was good. It seemed rather narrow, and it caused the code blocks to overflow. I compared this to [DHH's blog](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-6-hours-of-lex-888cbf16).
